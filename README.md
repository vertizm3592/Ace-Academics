Problem statement
On a campus as big as UNT, socializing over coursework is a struggle. It can be difficult to find the right study group, tutors, mentors, or even the right study spot. Especially during finals and midterms week, when the library is full students find it overwhelming to find a perfect study spot, leaving students stressed out. 

How will your tech solve it?
This app/website serves as a centralized hub/forum for setting up student study groups. Students can pick which topic to study/interested in, listed by course or subject, or major. We will partner with an institution for safety standards and measures. Students will no longer feel lost in the search for community or study spots.

Monetization
We can set up an optional premium subscription for students to set up a one on one study mentoring and tutoring session with their preferred instructors. Furthermore, they get priority while booking a study room or booth in the library and also access to lab or study spaces equipped with resources (unlocked via NFC).
